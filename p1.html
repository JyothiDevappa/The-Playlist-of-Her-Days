      <p>I woke up early today... and honestly? It felt like heaven. I went down to the ground floor and there he was our PG cooking uncle, already making tea. The moment he saw me, he poured one cup and gave it to me. He’s not just a cook anymore , he’s the tea master. He’s also become my friend. If I had to rate his tea? Full 5 stars! One sip, and my sleepy brain was like, “System activated!”, after finishing tea i step outside The world felt different. The sun kissed me with warm sunlight and a chill breeze, and the trees were doing slow-mo dances. Waking up early… it gives a fresh mind. A clean start. But the bitter truth about me? I mostly waste time thinking about what I should do instead of actually doing it. (Relatable 1000%.)</p>
      <p>When I was about to enter Nandanavana Park, the vibe just hit back. Birds were singing — like a Spotify playlist with no ads. I had missed this vibe… it’s been so long since I woke up early, I almost forgot mornings existed. I kept walking and saw some uncles reading newspapers. A few uncles had old songs playing on their phones, walking like heroes in a slow-motion movie. And suddenly, I remembered my old days... My mom, sharp at 6 a.m., used to play songs on the FM. Back then I was like, “Ahhh, again??” But now… it feels like sweet nostalgia.</p>
      <p>Everyone was doing exercise and yoga. When I saw the aunties in the park, some were working out like fitness champions — zero laziness. But a few? They were deep in gossip mode. I felt like they totally forgot why they even came. Did they really wake up early just to exercise their mouths instead of their bodies? Meanwhile, a few professional uncles were like, “My son’s going abroad,” “I just gifted him a car,” “Which property should I buy next?” And I was like, “Uncle, why not send him to Mars with a suitcase?”</p>
      <p>After hearing those professional-level life updates, I didn’t want to spoil my morning mood. So, I quietly sat in the middle of the park on a bench, hoping for peace. But nope — another round of uncle group discussion was already on. I was like, “Now what’s going on?” One uncle suddenly went full Shakespeare mode: <br> “Health is more important than money.” <br> But some other uncles — probably the ones without much money — started saying, “No sir, money is everything! If we have money, we can buy health too.” <br> Then the wise uncle hit back with a real story: <br> He shared about a friend who had it all — car, house, properties — but he was sick, couldn’t do anything on his own, and ended his life. That hit hard.</p>
      <p>When it comes to our side's morning routine... <br> Sometimes, I randomly wake up at 6 a.m., step outside, and there’s my mom — already cleaning the front yard, sprinkling water, and putting rangoli. The moment she saw me awake — she paused like time stopped and said, <br> “You woke up early? Today it might rain for sure!” <br> Or worse… “Sun might rise from the west today!” 😄</p>
      <p>Right across our house, there's this one legendary old lady. Wakes up at 4 a.m. sharp. Cleans her yard with full energy. But her actual job? Full-time gossiping. I swear she knows every family drama in the area. Certified CBI agent of the street.</p>
      <p>People heading to the dairy for milk, some curdling it at home, and the hardworking ones already in the fields doing farming work. Everyone’s busy with their own morning routine. In our house, we’ve got a tap, so no need to run around for water. But others? As soon as the tap turns on, everyone runs with pots… and boom — the real drama begins.</p>
      <p>After this mini tap drama, the street slowly cools down… <br> And in our house, my mom starts making the perfect tea. That moment? Pure peace.</p>
