    <h1 class="title">A day well spent at Fun World.</h1>
    <p>That morning, my excitement was bubbling like soda in a bottle — I couldn’t sit still! I got ready so fast, packed with full energy like a power bank on 100%. At 9 o’clock, my brother came to pick me up on his bike. I had just finished my breakfast.</p>

    <p>We started our fun ride. After some time, we reached Fun World. I was smiling non-stop! Soon, my brother’s friend joined us too. We were five members in total.</p>

    <p>We entered Fun World and it was like a full colourful blast—rides everywhere, loud music, people shouting, laughing, dancing, and already enjoying their rides. I was like, “Okay, what is this place? Heaven or what?” We quickly went to the changing room, changed our clothes, and kept our bags in the locker. We were all set to explore! And the best part? Four of us wore matching-matching clothes, Only one person wore a different colour, so we started calling him the odd one out! I saw some weird-looking rides and was like, “Uhh… I don’t even know what this is called, but it goes round and round like my thoughts before exams!”</p>

    <p>First, we went straight to one huge ride—tall like the Eiffel Tower! I was not scared at all. I was super excited. I was jumping around, pointing at it, saying, “Come on, let’s go for that ride! That one, that one!” I couldn’t wait. Somehow, we all climbed and screamed like anything. The ride slowly started going up, a little faster than I expected. We were already shouting like mad. And then it went too high… too high! I could literally see everything—clouds, the whole Fun World, people looking like ants! My heart was beating like dhoom-dhoom-dhoom. I was holding the handle so tight and shouting nonstop. After we came down, we didn’t laugh—we were just standing there like our minds were still on the ride. Everything felt like it was spinning. Our legs were shaking, and we were like, “What just happened?” We needed one minute to just breathe and stand properly. It was such a crazy ride!.</p>

    <p>After that intense ride, we straight went to the water park because the sun was too hot. There were many kinds of water slides. And to be honest, I’m scared of water. But did that stop me? No way! I was like, "Let's do this!" So, I sat on the slide, heart pounding, and whoosh—I was zooming down! It felt like I was gonna die (okay, a bit dramatic), but I made it! I hit the water with a big splash, and it felt like I was drowning for a second (okay, it wasn’t that bad, but it was scary!). My brother pulled me up and said, "Relax, it’s not that deep!" I was like, "Okay, fine!" But still, I was shaking. So, I thought, let’s try another slide.</p>

    <p>Its looks like dark cave-slide. We had to stand up inside it, and then they closed a glass door around us. We didn’t even press the button—they did it from outside! Suddenly, it opened, and boom—we fell down super fast! Water hit my eyes like a pressure pipe, I couldn’t even open them. And the slide? It was twisting like noodles—left, right, left, right—I couldn’t even guess where I was going! I was screaming like anything, a full high-pitched “AAAAA!” It was so scary but crazy fun too!</p>

    <p>Then came the big blue slide—the longest one! We all had to sit one by one with a tube under us. It started slowly, and I thought, "Okay, this is chill." But the moment we turned, it became super fast! Water splashing, the tube sliding like a snake, and I was just shouting, “What is this?!” It went round and round and dropped us straight into the pool. I came out like a soaked bread—hair everywhere, nose full of water</p>

    <p>After that slow floaty ride, we didn’t stop—we ran for another one! This one had a twisty tunnel, like a big blue snake. We had to sit in pairs again, and this time it went a bit faster. The tunnel was fully covered, so inside it was dark and the water kept splashing in our faces. I couldn’t even see my brother's face! I was shouting, “Where are we?!” and laughing at the same time. The ride twisted, turned, and suddenly dropped into a pool with a big splash. I came out of the water fixing my hair like a heroine and said, “Next ride!”</p>

    <p>One of my girl-friends was scared of everything. She didn’t play at all. She just stood there, praying to God and her mom every time we went on a ride! We went to a kid’s slide, thinking it would be fun, but it backfired! The water was not deep at all, and we landed like plop—no fun! But we still laughed.</p>

    <p>Then we went to the rain dance—cold water, loud music, and full energy! Everyone was dancing in their own style, doing crazy steps. I suddenly wanted tea, so we went to drink tea. Food was costly and not so tasty, but that tea—perfect!</p>

    <p>After tea, we went back to dancing. We even did steps to “Aaluma Doluma” like we were in a movie!</p>

    <p>Next, we visited the waterfall area. The water was so cold, but we loved it. We took photos and videos, laughed and played. My brother gave me a floating board, and I tried to swim in my own funny way!</p>

    <p>Then something cool happened—we met a little girl from sixth class who swam like a pro! She tried teaching me, but I couldn’t swim like her. Still, it was sweet.</p>

    <p>At last, we went to the lazy river. We floated peacefully for three rounds. It was so calm and relaxing.</p>

    <p>Then water park time was over. We changed our clothes and went to the dry rides.</p>

    <p>Those were next-level! The rides go up—happy happy happy! Then suddenly down—ohhh haaa! We screamed like anything!</p>

    <p>We four stood together for the Sky Drop ride. I took a deep breath, my heart already racing. The ride started going up slowly… higher… higher… and I was like, “Okay okay okay what is this!” Then suddenly—ZOOOOOOM! It dropped down so fast, I screamed like never before. My stomach felt like it was flipping nonstop. One of our girls even started praying, “Oh God, please save me!” like it was her last moment! And they didn’t stop there—they spun us around for one full minute! On the next spin, I felt like a bird flying without wings, totally out of control. When we reached the ground, I was like—“WHAT JUST HAPPENED!”</p>

    <p>It felt like we were flying in the sky and touching the clouds. We tried almost every ride and enjoyed like crazy!</p>

    <p>We waited and waited, watching the other group scream their lungs out. Finally, it was our turn! The downstairs gate opened slowly — just like in Squid Game — and we walked in. The ride was a giant round spinning thing, so big and crazy-looking. We sat on our seats, and suddenly, the seats closed by themselves and the staff came to tighten all our belts. I was like, “Wait... is this really safe?” Before we could even blink, it started spinning slowly… and then—WHOOSH! It went full speed! Left, right, up, down — like Earth was rotating in fast-forward. I screamed, laughed, and held my seat tight like my life depended on it!</p>

    <p>After that, we ran to another crazy ride — this one called the Hanging Drop! We sat down, feet dangling, and suddenly it started going up… slowly… then fully reversed! When we reached the top, it stopped for a few seconds. I swear, in that moment, I was just staring at the ground like, “If this seatbelt breaks, I’m gone!” My heart was beating like a drum. Then BOOM! It dropped again, and again! I couldn’t even scream properly — I was just praying to survive. That ride seriously scared me the most!</p>

    <p>Next, we went for the boat ride. It looked slow from outside, but once we sat in, I realized — no seatbelt! Just holding the sides tightly. It started swinging like a big cradle, left and right… higher and higher! I was a little scared, and something was happening in my stomach — like butterflies dancing!</p>

    <p>And then, one last time, we went for that Eiffel Tower ride again. But this time, I didn’t scream. I just sat like I was sleeping! I wasn’t scared anymore — that fear was gone. We were all tired, but our hearts were full. It was the final ride of the day — and just like that, our crazy, fun, tired day came to an end.</p>

    <p>After all the water rides and screaming, we went back to the locker, opened it, took our bags, and stepped out of Fun World. My brother went to get his bike, and the rest of us—four of us—started walking around, searching for a hotel to eat. Luckily, we found Udupi Hotel.</p>

    <p>We ordered gobi, fried rice, onion dosa, and roti with curry. But I was so sleepy, I just kept my head on the table and slept until the food came. The food didn’t taste that good. I was feeling too tired and unsatisfied. After finishing the food, my brother dropped me back to my PG.</p>

    <p> Now here comes the bonus part—the lift was not working. And my room is on the fourth floor. Already tired, and now this! I just told myself, “Sir, I can’t do anything, but I have to walk.” Step by step, dragging myself, I climbed to the top like a warrior.

      When I finally entered my room, it felt like I stepped into heaven. All my tiredness, all my stress just vanished. I jumped onto the bed and fell asleep like a stone.
      
      Two hours later, one of my roommates woke me up and said, “Come, let’s go for tea.” And you know me—I never say no to tea! Doesn’t matter how tired I am or where I’ve been, once I’m back in my room, something just activates in me. Tea is life!
      
      While we were talking, another roommate told me something unexpected—she said she felt depressed the whole day because I wasn’t there. She said she felt lonely, was crying, playing sad songs, and even wanted to run away. I was like, “What?! You missed me this much?”
      
      I was really shocked and touched. It felt weird but also nice, knowing someone missed me that badly.
      
      After that, we three went out for tea, drank it, laughed a little, and came back to PG. I changed, got into bed, and slept like a baby. </p>
