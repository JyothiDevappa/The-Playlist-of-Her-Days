    <h1> World Paused at 5 PM </h1> 
<div class="story-text">

    <p><em>“It’s evening time, around 5 PM.”</em></p>
    <p>
      I love this kind of atmosphere, so I decided to step outside for some tea.  
      I wash my face, tie my hair into a ponytail, and step out, leaving the PG for some fresh air.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Just a few steps away is my regular tea spot, with its familiar plastic chairs waiting like always.  
      I sit where I always do and order one hot tea and a warm egg puff.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The tea smells perfect, and the puff breaks softly in my hand.  
      While sipping slowly...
    </p>
  
    <p><em>“It’s dog o’clock.”</em></p>
    <p>
      Dogs all happy, walking like they own the road.  
      And the street dogs? They stare like, “Who are you? Why are you here? Who gave you permission?”  
      —basically shouting in their own dog language!  
      Honestly, it’s like a full-on drama episode, and I’m just there, sipping tea, watching the show.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      People pass by, busy with their own thoughts—like small stories walking past me.  
      The shop uncle smiles at me, says the usual kind words, already knowing how much I love tea—  
      like he’s part of my routine.
    </p>
  
    <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px dotted #999; margin: 40px 0;" />
  
    <p><em>“After my tea break, I walk to the nearby park.”</em></p>
    <p>
      The path feels calm under my steps.  
      These days, yellow flowers bloom everywhere like tiny suns on green beds.  
      “Hello, flowers,” I whisper, as if they can hear me.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I sit on a bench with my diary, pen moving slowly, writing thoughts I don’t say out loud.  
      Kids run across the grass, laughing, while some people walk with tired faces.  
      I just sit, watch, and breathe.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      As the sky fades into night, the streetlights blink on, shining quietly like stars that came down early.  
      A soft breeze brushes past me like a quiet hug.  
      I close my diary, press it gently to my chest, and smile to myself.
    </p>
